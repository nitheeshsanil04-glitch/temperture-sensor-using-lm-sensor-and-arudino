# Arduino Temperature Sensor using LM35 and 7 LEDs

## Description
This project measures temperature using an LM35 temperature sensor
and displays the temperature level using 7 LEDs. As the temperature
increases, LEDs turn ON one by one.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- 7 LEDs
- 7 × 220Ω Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Circuit Diagram
(Will be added)

## Working Principle
- LM35 outputs 10 mV per °C
- Arduino reads analog value from pin A0
- Based on temperature range, LEDs glow progressively

## How to Run
1. Open the Tinkercad simulation link
2. Click Start Simulation
3. Adjust LM35 temperature slider
4. Observe LED indication

## Applications
- Temperature monitoring
- Overheat indication
- Beginner Arduino learning project
